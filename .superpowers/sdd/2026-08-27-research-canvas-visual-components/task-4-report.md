# Task 4 report — persistent canvas geometry and corner resize

## Status

Implemented one normalized geometry model for Research canvas nodes, persisted
the normalized shape, replaced fixed hit rectangles with real node dimensions,
and added four-corner resize behavior to the installed conversation renderer.
No composer, sidebar, version, update-feed, or release code was changed.

## RED

The first focused run was made after adding pure and mounted-renderer tests and
before changing the installed dependency:

```text
Test Files  2 failed (2)
Tests       10 failed | 120 passed (130)
```

The failures were the intended missing behavior: no exported geometry
normalizer or resize helper, viewport rectangles still fixed at 220 x 64,
legacy JSON lacked normalized sizes, and the mounted real `ResearchCanvas`
rendered no handles, preview shield, or live resize operation.

A second narrow RED cycle covered preview wheel ownership. The mounted real
rich preview body bubbled into the canvas wheel listener and produced
`defaultPrevented: true`; after the ownership guard it remained unprevented and
the viewport stayed unchanged.

## Geometry policy

All values are world units. `x` and `y` remain node centers.

| Kind | Default | Minimum | Aspect behavior |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Generic unsupported file | 220 x 64 | fixed | not resizable; no handles |
| Assistant artifact | 360 x 240 | 240 x 120 | free; 240 is the Task 4 safe auto-height placeholder |
| Image / SVG | 320 x 272 | 160 x 152 | 4:3 content plus 32 title pixels |
| PDF | 320 x 446.117647 | 240 x 342.588235 | 17:22 page content plus 32 title pixels |
| HTML | 480 x 360 | 320 x 240 | free |

The shared title bar is 32 px. The shared maximum is 2400 x 2400. Image and
PDF `aspectRatio` applies only to content height, never to the title bar.
Persisted natural ratios are admitted only when finite and between 0.25 and 8,
then narrowed to the type's feasible range under both its minimum dimensions
and the 2400 x 2400 ceiling. Invalid, non-finite, and negative sizes fall back
to the kind default; finite sizes are clamped. Legacy nodes normalize on load
and are repaired on the next workspace persistence write.

Rich-kind detection is centralized: supported `image/*` and known image/SVG
extensions map to image, PDF MIME/extension maps to PDF, HTML/XHTML
MIME/extension maps to HTML, supported assistant artifact kinds map to
assistant, and everything else maps to generic.

## Interaction semantics

- Space-pan is checked first, including pointer-down over a resize handle or an
  interactive preview body.
- A selected rich node renders NW, NE, SW, and SE handles. A generic node never
  renders handles.
- Resize precedes normal card movement and changes only the operated node, even
  when a group is selected.
- Pointer screen deltas are divided by canvas scale. The actual clamped size
  delta shifts the center by half, keeping the opposite corner fixed.
- Assistant and HTML resize freely. Image and PDF resize proportionally using
  their content ratio.
- Live move/resize publishes in-memory geometry without storage writes.
  Pointer-up, pointer-cancel, window blur, and unmount each persist once.
- The title/noninteractive frame remains the move surface; marked rich preview
  bodies own pointer and wheel interaction.
- Rich nodes always contain a real preview shield layer. Space-pan, node move,
  and resize activate it through root interaction state so Task 6 iframes
  cannot steal an active pointer. No generic card or fake iframe was used in
  the rendered tests.
- Existing selection, group move, marquee, Delete, and context deletion paths
  remain exercised by the focused mounted-renderer suite.

## Patch evidence

The installed dependency was regenerated with:

```text
npx patch-package @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-conversation
✔ Created file patches/@deepseek-ai+dsh-client-ui-conversation+0.1.0-rc.7.patch
```

The regenerated full patch still contains the approved shared InputBar
`padding-bottom: 8px` replacement and the previous Research implementation,
plus the new normalizer, resize helper, shared rich frame, handles, shield, and
pointer operation branches. `git apply --check --reverse` succeeds against the
installed tree.

No `.d.ts` file was changed: the package's public declaration index does not
declare the existing Research runtime/testing exports, and Task 4 did not
change a consumed TypeScript contract.

## Review fix round 1

Review identified two important boundary defects and both received a separate
RED/GREEN cycle:

1. An admitted wide image ratio of 8 previously normalized 160 x 52, violating
   the image policy's 160 x 152 minimum. A new pure regression failed with that
   exact result. Normalization and resize now share constraints whose minimum
   width is `max(type minWidth, (type minHeight - titleHeight) * ratio)` and
   whose maximum width accounts for both global width and content-height
   ceilings. The regression now yields 960 x 152; a 0.25 ratio also remains at
   least 160 x 672. Ratios are narrowed further only when the type minima and
   global maxima otherwise have no feasible intersection.
2. Repositioning a deduplicated assistant artifact rebuilt it without geometry,
   resetting 720 x 480 manual state to 360 x 240 auto. A new pure regression
   failed with that reset. The found-node branch now retains its canonical
   persisted width, height, size mode, and applicable aspect ratio while still
   updating title, content, and center position.

The review-fix RED was `2 failed | 58 passed` in
`test/research-file-drop.test.ts`; its immediate GREEN was `60 passed`.

## GREEN and verification

Final evidence is recorded from fresh runs immediately before commit:

- `npm test -- --run test/research-file-drop.test.ts test/sherlock-composer-workspace-ui.test.ts`
  — 2 files, 132 tests passed.
- `npm run typecheck` — exit 0.
- `git diff --check` — exit 0.
- `git apply --check --reverse patches/@deepseek-ai+dsh-client-ui-conversation+0.1.0-rc.7.patch`
  — exit 0.

## Self-review and risks

- Geometry is defined once and both persistence and viewport hit-testing call
  that same normalizer; Task 5/6 should extend preview bodies, not introduce a
  second sizing model.
- Assistant auto height intentionally remains a safe 240-unit placeholder until
  Task 5 installs the specified `ResizeObserver` measurement.
- Image natural ratio and PDF first-page ratio will replace their initial
  ratios in Tasks 5/6. The current admission bounds prevent corrupt persisted
  ratios from producing unusable geometry.
- HTML and PDF bodies are placeholders at this task boundary. The shared frame,
  wheel/pointer ownership marker, and shield are production renderer behavior
  ready for their real preview consumers.
- No full test suite or local packaged-app run was performed because this task's
  brief requires only the two focused files, typecheck, patch validation, and
  diff checks; final real-app QA belongs to Task 7.
